REMIX PROJECT- COM. Patrick McBrien & Nathanial Millet. XOM.APP. This is an ethereum token that can be use with an augmented reality and 3d experience over media mobile application that uses a camera and LIDAR to scan ones environment to present 3d objects and market products from large retailers Walmart, Amazon, Google, Nike, and individuals using the app can also create their very own 3d digital objects to sell for XomTokens on the app. It is powered by Google Firebase.

What is an ERC20 token?

An ERC20 token is a blockchain-based asset with similar functionality to bitcoin, ether, and bitcoin cash: it can hold value and be sent and received.
The major difference between ERC20 tokens and other cryptocurrencies is that ERC20 tokens are created and hosted on the Ethereum blockchain, whereas bitcoin and bitcoin cash are the native currencies of their respective blockchains.
ERC20 tokens are stored and sent using ethereum addresses and transactions, and use gas to cover transaction fees.

Remix example project is present when Remix loads very first time or there are no files existing in the File Explorer. 
It contains 3 directories:

1. 'contracts': Holds three contracts with different complexity level, denoted with number prefix in file name.
2. 'scripts': Holds two scripts to deploy a contract. It is explained below.
3. 'tests': Contains one test file for 'Ballot' contract with unit tests in Solidity.

SCRIPTS

The 'scripts' folder contains example async/await scripts for deploying the 'Storage' contract.
For the deployment of any other contract, 'contractName' and 'constructorArgs' should be updated (along with other code if required). 
Scripts have full access to the web3.js and ethers.js libraries.

To run a script, right click on file name in the file explorer and click 'Run'. Remember, Solidity file must already be compiled.

Output from script will appear in remix terminal.
